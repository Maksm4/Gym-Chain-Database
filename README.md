    OVERVIEW  
The gym database is a relational database that is designed to manage information related to employees, customers and gym equipment,
it also allows us to store information about the types and plans of memberships including the status payment of the specific customers membership.
The database takes care of keeping the track of the training sessions with each trainer and possibly multiple customers including the time of the session
as well as the time of the check in and check out of the customer. Additionally it tells us about what equipment,
and when was bought for the specific facility and which trainers are giving training sessions at that facility.
It is written in PL/SQL as well as T-SQL dialects in their dedicated folders with diffrent triggers and prcoedures that could have
a real use in a real life database. In addition there is provided a png(created in vertabelo) file with a visualization of the database and relations
between tables. If needed there is also provided a drop table file that deletes the relations and tables from the database.

Triggers are a kind of procedure that is executed every time a specific action occures. For example before inserting an entry to the specific table.
- CREATE OR REPLACE means that if a trigger with that name  already exists it would be replaced by this trigger and if it doesn't \
 it will just create the trigger
- BEFORE INSERT OR UDPATE This keyword means that the trigger should be fired before the execution of the create or update action taken on
  some table
- ON means which table should a trigger operate on.
- there is also a check case provided for each trigger to make sure it is working properly
